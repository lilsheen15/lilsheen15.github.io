Cloud Native Computing: 

Cloud computing is becoming very popular nowadays and a lot of companies are transitioning to the cloud environment. Cloud computing allows users to have a storage space online that can be accessed from anywhere. It lets users store and process their data in the third party data centers to be retrieved later through the network. Many projects are created on open source platforms and they are worked on in the cloud environment. According to the website cncf.io, “The Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s mission is to create and drive the adoption of a new computing paradigm that is optimized for modern distributed systems environments.” They are using this as the stepping stone to creating these Linux projects on this cloud system. The system will be “container packaged” which means that it will be running in application containers, it will do this as a unit of application deployment and as a mechanism to achieve high levels of resource isolation in order to improve the overall developer experience and make operations simpler. It will be “dynamically managed” that will be scheduled and managed by a central coordinating process to improve machine efficiency, while reducing the cost associated with maintenance and operations. Lastly the system will be “micro-services oriented” that is coupled with dependencies described through service endpoints with the goal of overall agility and maintainability of applications. This process makes it easier for developers and organizations by driving alignment among technologies and platforms. The project members include: Platinum: Cisco, CoreOS, Docker, Google, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Joyent, Mesosphere, redhat, & Supernap. Gold: at&t, NetApp. Silver: Apcera, AppFormix, Apprenda, AVI Networks, Centrify, Cloudsoft, ClusterHQ, ContainerSolutions, Cyclecomputing, Datawise.io, DEIS, ebay, eldarion, Fujitsu, iguaz.io, infoblox, ishi systems, Kismatic, Calico, ncsoft, NEC, NGINX, portworx, rancher, RX-M, Scalock, sysdig, twistlock, twitter, Univa, Virtuozzo, vmware, weaveworks, Williams Garcia. Academic: Software Engineering Lab. End User: Goldman Sachs. The CNCF project will be established as a collaborative project within the organizational structure of The Linux Foundation. The project participants are the members and the online community that contributes to the project. When people participate in the coding of the project it has to go through a process which the governing board will evaluate. It will go through the evaluation process before the code is committed and reviewed before it is merged into the master code. The Code of Conduct for now is that all participants agree to abide by The Linux Foundation Code of Conduct available at http://events.linuxfoundation.org/code-of-conduct. The TSC may vote to adopt its own code of conduct for the CNCF community. People can get involved by participating as a member or by giving their input in the Blog on their site. They also have a contact us link which can be used to give your input for the website. So the CNCF project is to get more projects created on their platform and what they will do is maintain the different open source projects that are running through their structure. According to their governance structure the standard protocol to achieve committer status shall be through established across projects based on an individual’s level and duration of contribution. Maintainer status is achieved through contribution to a given project over time and validation by peer committers. Once approved and people sign up and make a contribution then it will go through the evaluation process and then finally get committed.
